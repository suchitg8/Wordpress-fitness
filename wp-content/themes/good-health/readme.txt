== Description ==
Good Health is a modern and sophisticated blog design created for health and fitness bloggers in particular, but can be used by anyone who wants a fresh and modern look. The theme includes the ability to display your local business information in the header, and comes with an alternative home page template which you can use as a simple and clear landing page with a single call to action. It also supports the Instagram Feed plugin so you can promote your Insta as well. The blog layout is a fun masonry style with support for the popular post formats too.
