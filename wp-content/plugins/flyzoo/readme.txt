Yes, but you still need to provide your production url when you sign up.

= How do I embed a group chat into a page? =

Log into the Dashboard, click on SETUP > LAYOUT & FEATURES and select the DOCK or USER LIST MODE
(the SIDE CHAT mode does not support embedded group chats). Finally click on SETUP > GROUP CHATS,

Here you find the shortcode (or javascript version). Copy the shortcode and past it into the desired page.

No, the chat is loaded asynchronously and our servers will handle all the chat workload.

Probably pages are being cached. Please try to:

- refresh your browser's cache

Otherwise, please check that you haven't embedded the chat script into some .php file - like footer.php for instance.
